## This project
This is an elevator project that my friend Alex and I did for a project for my Design of Large Problems class. This elevator is an example of OOP Design that was heavily edited and initerated on with the help of our professor as we were working close with him to develop further examples for the class in place of doing the work for the course. This elevator will potentially be an example he uses to teach students about OOP Design and structure. In this project, beyond the learning of OOP Design, my partner and I learned about threads, JavaFX, as well as several ideas of workflow, as this was the first group project either of us had ever done.
